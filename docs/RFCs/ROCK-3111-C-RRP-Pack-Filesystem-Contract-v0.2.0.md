# ROCK-3111-C
**Title:** RRP Pack Filesystem Contract v0.2.0  
**Status:** Draft  
**Series:** ROCK 3100+ Extension Pack Range  
**Depends on:** Rosetta v3.0.0 Core Spine; ROCK-3111; ROCK-3111-A; ROCK-3111-B; Doctrine v0.2  
**Scope:** Define the normative filesystem, manifest, validation, conformance, and release contract for Rosetta packs, with an RRP-specific concrete instantiation.

---

## 0. Intent

This contract is the missing bridge between “we have pack ideas” and “the repository knows exactly how a pack must exist on disk, how it must be validated, how it evolves, and what must be green before it can claim conformance.”

It serves two simultaneous goals:

1. make packs predictable and machine-checkable for humans, CI, and coding agents
2. keep Rosetta’s constitutional center stable by forcing new semantics into packs instead of casual core mutation

This contract defines a **generic pack root contract** and an **RRP-specific specialization**.

---

## 1. Normative pack model

### 1.1 Pack categories
A pack MUST declare exactly one primary category:

- `StdPack` — standard/protocol alignment pack
- `VocabPack` — taxonomy / SKOS / vocabulary pack
- `SchemaPack` — JSON Schema / SHACL / examples pack
- `GovernancePack` — policy / rules / guard-adjacent pack
- `RecipePack` — reusable workflow or compositional recipe pack
- `SkillPack` — reusable agent/operator behavior pack
- `PersonaPack` — identity/persona/council pack (non-core; elevated governance applies)

A pack MAY expose cross-category exports, but MUST name one primary category.

### 1.2 Pack identity
Each pack MUST expose:
- stable `pack_id`
- human-readable `name`
- `namespace`
- semver `version`
- `doc_id` where applicable
- compatibility range for Rosetta core
- content-addressed export metadata or file hashes

### 1.3 Refinement-first rule
Packs MUST extend core semantics without redefining or silently mutating Rosetta core meanings.  
If a change requires core semantic mutation, it is not a pack change and must be escalated out of band.

---

## 2. Required generic pack root

Every pack root MUST exist under:

```txt
packs/<pack-name>/
```

Minimum required files:

```txt
packs/<pack-name>/
  pack.json
  README.md
  CHANGELOG.md
  acceptance.md
  metadata.json
  examples/
  tests/
```

Additional required subtrees depend on pack category.

### 2.1 Required root files

#### `pack.json`
Normative machine manifest. REQUIRED.

#### `README.md`
Human-first overview including:
- purpose
- scope
- included exports
- prerequisites
- quickstart
- conformance claims
- known limitations
- version notes

#### `CHANGELOG.md`
Semver-aligned change history. REQUIRED once the pack is past `0.0.x`.

#### `acceptance.md`
Explicit acceptance gates for this pack:
- what must pass
- what must fail
- merge blockers
- release blockers
- profile-specific behavior if any

#### `metadata.json`
Contribution metadata for humans and agents. SHOULD include:
- owner/maintainer
- source doctrine
- intended lifecycle stage
- automation hints
- agent-readable tags
- security classification

#### `examples/`
Minimal and representative examples. At least one valid example is REQUIRED.

#### `tests/`
Pack-specific tests and/or pointers to fixtures. A pack without tests cannot claim conformance.

---

## 3. Generic optional-but-standard subtrees

These are optional generically, but standard if applicable:

```txt
schema/
shacl/
vocab/
profiles/
test-vectors/
receipts-fixtures/
policy/
migrations/
translators/
docs/
```

### 3.1 `schema/`
Use when JSON Schemas or related machine contracts exist.

### 3.2 `shacl/`
Use when RDF/graph constraints are part of the pack.  
For schema-heavy or provenance-heavy packs, SHACL is strongly recommended.

### 3.3 `vocab/`
Use for controlled vocabularies, SKOS concept schemes, enums, registries.

### 3.4 `profiles/`
Use for light/full/auditor/forge or other named conformance profiles.

### 3.5 `test-vectors/`
Use for deterministic canonical vectors, expected outputs, tamper negatives, translator vectors.

### 3.6 `receipts-fixtures/`
Use when the pack emits or verifies important receipts.

### 3.7 `policy/`
Use when the pack includes policy bundles, default rules, or policy fragments.

### 3.8 `migrations/`
Use when version-to-version migration scripts or plans exist.

### 3.9 `translators/`
Use when schema evolution or semantic mapping is handled via translators.

---

## 4. `pack.json` contract

### 4.1 Required fields

```json
{
  "pack_id": "cid:...",
  "name": "RRP",
  "doc_id": "ROCK-3111-C",
  "category": "SchemaPack",
  "namespace": "rrp",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "status": "draft",
  "compatible_core": {
    "min": "3.0.0",
    "max_exclusive": "4.0.0"
  },
  "depends_on": [
    {"doc_id": "ROCK-3111", "version_range": "^0.1.0"}
  ],
  "owners": [
    {"name": "Entif/Rosetta maintainers", "role": "editor"}
  ],
  "exports": [],
  "entrypoints": {},
  "profiles": [],
  "source_of_truth": {
    "doctrine": "Doctrine v0.2",
    "traceability_required": true
  }
}
```

### 4.2 Field semantics
- `pack_id`: SHOULD be content-addressed when pack release is frozen
- `category`: MUST match one of the supported primary categories
- `namespace`: MUST be unique within the repo
- `compatible_core`: MUST define the Rosetta core compatibility window
- `depends_on`: MUST include required pack/doc dependencies
- `exports`: MUST enumerate machine-consumable assets if present
- `profiles`: MUST enumerate declared conformance profiles if present
- `entrypoints`: SHOULD identify canonical file entrypoints for automation

### 4.3 Export entry format
Example:

```json
{
  "kind": "json-schema",
  "id": "rrp.receipt-content",
  "path": "schema/receipt-content.schema.json",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "hash": "sha256-...",
  "profile": "light"
}
```

---

## 5. File-level traceability headers

Protocol-sensitive files SHOULD begin with a terse machine-checkable header block.

Recommended minimum:

```txt
DocID: ROCK-3111-C
Artifact: rrp.receipt-content
Version: 0.2.0
Status: Draft
Depends-On: Rosetta-v3.0.0, ROCK-3111, ROCK-3111-A, ROCK-3111-B
Source-Of-Truth: packs/rrp/pack.json
```

Headers are REQUIRED for:
- normative schemas
- SHACL files
- policy bundles
- translator specs
- generated conformance fixtures if intended as canonical vectors

---

## 6. Conformance profiles

A pack MAY declare named conformance profiles.  
If no profiles are declared, the pack is assumed single-profile.

Recommended standard profile names:
- `light`
- `full`
- `auditor`
- `forge`

Each declared profile MUST specify:
- included exports
- excluded exports
- mandatory tests
- optional tests
- known non-goals
- compatibility guarantees

Profiles SHOULD live under:

```txt
profiles/<profile-name>.json
```

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "light",
  "required_exports": [
    "rrp.receipt-content",
    "rrp.receipt-bundle-tapestry"
  ],
  "required_tests": [
    "tv1",
    "tamper-negative"
  ],
  "forbidden_claims": [
    "auditor-level-full-closure"
  ]
}
```

---

## 7. Release and migration rules

### 7.1 Semver
- breaking schema or meaning changes require a major bump
- additive fields, vocab items, or examples may be minor bumps
- typo/docs/example-only changes may be patch bumps if no normative surface changed

### 7.2 Migration artifacts
Any breaking or translator-relevant pack update MUST include at least one of:
- translator spec in `translators/`
- migration notes in `migrations/`
- example before/after fixtures
- updated test vectors
- migration receipts if the repo runtime emits them

### 7.3 Backwards compatibility
Packs SHOULD prefer additive evolution and translator-based compatibility rather than deletion or redefinition.

---

## 8. CI and acceptance gates for all packs

A pack may claim “conformant” only if all relevant gates are green.

Minimum generic gates:
- manifest validation
- required file presence
- schema parse/validation where applicable
- example validation
- test-vector execution where applicable
- traceability header checks where required
- no broken export paths
- changelog updated for normative changes

A pack MUST refuse merge if:
- `pack.json` is missing required fields
- required files are absent
- declared exports do not exist
- examples fail validation
- required vectors fail
- release version changed without changelog
- major change has no migration note or translator strategy

---

## 9. RRP-specific specialization

Pack root:

```txt
packs/rrp/
```

Required tree:

```txt

### 9.1 RRP-specific `pack.json` example

```json
{
  "pack_id": "cid:rrp-pack-placeholder",
  "name": "Receipt Refinement Pack",
  "doc_id": "ROCK-3111-C",
  "category": "SchemaPack",
  "namespace": "rrp",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "status": "draft",
  "compatible_core": {
    "min": "3.0.0",
    "max_exclusive": "4.0.0"
  },
  "depends_on": [
    {"doc_id": "ROCK-3111", "version_range": "^0.1.0"},
    {"doc_id": "ROCK-3111-A", "version_range": "^0.1.0"},
    {"doc_id": "ROCK-3111-B", "version_range": "^0.1.0"}
  ],
  "owners": [
    {"name": "Entif/Rosetta maintainers", "role": "editor"}
  ],
  "exports": [
    {"kind": "json-schema", "id": "rrp.receipt-content", "path": "schema/receipt-content.schema.json", "version": "0.2.0"},
    {"kind": "json-schema", "id": "rrp.receipt-bundle-tapestry", "path": "schema/receipt-bundle-tapestry.schema.json", "version": "0.2.0"},
    {"kind": "shacl", "id": "rrp.receipt.shapes", "path": "shacl/receipt.shapes.ttl", "version": "0.2.0"},
    {"kind": "vocab", "id": "rrp.receipt-types", "path": "vocab/receipt-types.json", "version": "0.2.0"}
  ],
  "profiles": [
    {"name": "light", "path": "profiles/light.json"},
    {"name": "full", "path": "profiles/full.json"},
    {"name": "auditor", "path": "profiles/auditor.json"}
  ],
  "entrypoints": {
    "primary_schema": "schema/receipt-content.schema.json",
    "primary_bundle_schema": "schema/receipt-bundle-tapestry.schema.json"
  },
  "source_of_truth": {
    "doctrine": "Doctrine v0.2",
    "traceability_required": true
  }
}
```

---

## 10. Example generic contribution subtree rules

Because the doctrine imports OB1-inspired contribution ergonomics, the following subtrees are recommended for future non-core pack-like contributions:

```txt
recipes/<name>/
  README.md
  metadata.json
  acceptance.md
  examples/
  tests/

skills/<name>/
  README.md
  metadata.json
  acceptance.md
  examples/
  tests/
```

These are not RRP pack roots, but they should follow the same manifest discipline.

---

## 11. Test vector naming rules

Normative vector files SHOULD follow:

- `<vector-id>.hash-input.json`
- `<vector-id>.expected.json`
- `<vector-id>.tampered.json`
- `<vector-id>.invalid.json`
- `<vector-id>.notes.md` (optional)

Vector IDs SHOULD be stable and human-legible:
- `tv1`
- `tv2`
- `bundle-guard-allow`
- `bundle-guard-expired`

---

## 12. Acceptance checklist for RRP

RRP pack is acceptable only if all are true:

1. required tree exists
2. schemas validate
3. SHACL files parse
4. vocab files parse and match referenced enums
5. examples validate against schemas
6. `tv1` deterministic output passes
7. tamper-negative vectors fail verification
8. profile declarations resolve to real files
9. traceability headers pass
10. changelog updated for normative changes

### Must fail if
- receipt example omits required `subjects`
- bundle example references missing subjects/evidence tiles
- signature/digest mismatch passes accidentally
- undeclared vocab items appear in examples
- release claims conformance without vectors

---

## 13. Release policy

A pack may be tagged for release only if:
- pack validation green
- relevant vectors green
- acceptance gates green
- migration notes included when needed
- docs updated
- no unresolved known-red-tests within the pack’s own merge-critical surface

---

## 14. Immediate next implementation actions

1. scaffold `packs/rrp/` exactly to this contract
2. validate `pack.json` with a repo-level manifest validator
3. move current RRP schema/spec assets into this tree
4. write CI target `nx run packs-rrp:conformance`
5. generate initial vector set (`tv1`, tamper-negative, signature-negative)
6. add pack contract checker to pre-commit / CI

This contract is now the filesystem law for RRP and the template for later pack families.
